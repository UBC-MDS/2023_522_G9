## Project Overview 

Prediction of daily precipitation is a fundamental aspect of meteorological studies [1]. Accurate precipitation prediction is crucial for agriculture, water resources management, as well as daily activities of people. Specifically, in a geographically and climatically diverse region like Vancouver, predicting precipitation is vital for people to prepare for extreme weather events, reducing hazards and minimizing property damage.

In this project, we aim to predict the occurrence and the amount of daily precipitation in Vancouver using machine learning (ML) classification methods [2]. Specifically, our analysis utilizes a dataset containing daily precipitation information in Vancouver from 1990 to the present (i.e., 6 Nov, 2023). This dataset, sourced from Open-Meteo‚Äôs Historical Weather API [3], includes a number of parameters relevant to precipitation prediction. Key parameters include month, daily temperature measures, wind speeds, wind direction, shortwave radiation, and ET‚ÇÄ reference evapotranspiration. Specifically, shortwave radiation represents the sum of solar energy received in a day; ET‚ÇÄ reference evapotranspiration provides an indication of the atmospheric demand for moisture (i.e., higher relative humidity reduces ET‚ÇÄ ); and month is also included as a variable since it accounts for the seasonal variations in precipitation [4]. This project may contributes insights into accurate forecast of the precipitation in Vancouver.

## Report

The final report will be available when the report [page]() is created.
